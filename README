Multithreading Benchmark Project
CompSci 371

Used parts of the thead example and part of the time example provided for us from class.
This project is basically an extensive modification of my open source project, which is
a program that sorts a list of names. I used 100 names and copied and pasted them over 
and over again until I had a huge list of names. 

First, using a single thread, this program takes a list of names from the command line and 
sorts them alphabetically. Then the program does the same thing again, but splits using four 
threads instead of one. Both trials are timed and displayed at the end of each run.
